/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of the Auth0 FGA (Fine-Grained Authorization)
 * with a vector store index to query documents with permission checks.
 *
 * The FGARetriever checks if the user has the "viewer" relation to the document
 * based on predefined tuples in Auth0 FGA.
 *
 * Example:
 * - A tuple {user: "user:*", relation: "viewer", object: "doc:public-doc"} allows all users to view "public-doc".
 * - A tuple {user: "user:user1", relation: "viewer", object: "doc:private-doc"} allows "user1" to view "private-doc".
 *
 * The output of the query depends on the user's permissions to view the documents.
