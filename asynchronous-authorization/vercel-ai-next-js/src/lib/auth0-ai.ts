   * The behavior when the authorization request is made.
   * 
   * - `block`: The tool execution is blocked until the user completes the authorization.
   * - `interrupt`: The tool execution is interrupted until the user completes the authorization.
   * - a callback: Same as "block" but give access to the auth request and executing logic.
   * 
   * Defaults to `interrupt`.
   *
   * When this flag is set to `block`, the execution of the tool awaits
   * until the user approves or rejects the request.
   * Given the asynchronous nature of the CIBA flow, this mode
   * is only useful during development.
   *
   * In practice, the process that is awaiting the user confirmation
   * could crash or timeout before the user approves the request.
